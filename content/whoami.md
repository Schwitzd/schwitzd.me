:wave:, I'm **Daniel** and I've been in the IT world for as long as I can remember. I'm fascinated by all technology things, but my current passions lie in Security and DevOps.

I have been using Linux since back in 2003 when my father made me try SUSE Linux, from there I have tried them all. currently I use Arch Linux on my laptop and Debian on my Servers.

:open_book: Much of my knowledge comes from people in the internet community who have decided to share their expertise freely. This website and my [Github page](https://github.com/Schwitzd/) is my commitment to give something back to the community in the hope that one day someone will benefit from my resources.
